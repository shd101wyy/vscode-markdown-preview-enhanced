## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.1] - 2023-10-06

Updated [crossnote](https://github.com/shd101wyy/crossnote) to version [0.8.19](https://github.com/shd101wyy/crossnote/releases/tag/0.8.19).

### Changes

- Deprecated the `processWikiLink` in `parser.js`. Now `crossnote` handles how we process the wiki link.  
  We also added two more options:
  - `wikiLinkTargetFileExtension`: The file extension of the target file. Default is `md`. For example:
    - `[[test]]` will be transformed to `[test](test.md)`
    - `[[test.md]]` will be transformed to `[test](test.md)`
    - `[[test.pdf]]` will be transformed to `[test](test.pdf)` because it has a file extension.
  - `wikiLinkTargetFileNameChangeCase`: How we transform the file name. Default is `none` so we won't change the file name.  
    A list of available options can be found at: https://shd101wyy.github.io/crossnote/types/WikiLinkTargetFileNameChangeCase.html

### Bug fixes

- Reverted the markdown transformer and deleted the logic of inserting anchor elements as it's causing a lot of problems.  
  The in-preview editor is not working as expected. So we now hide its highlight lines and elements feature if the markdown file failed to generate the correct source map.
- Fixed the bug that global custom CSS is not working.

## [0.8.0] - 2023-10-05

Updated [crossnote](https://github.com/shd101wyy/crossnote) to version [0.8.17](https://github.com/shd101wyy/crossnote/releases/tag/0.8.17) then version [0.8.18](https://github.com/shd101wyy/crossnote/releases/tag/0.8.18).

### New features

- üìù Supported in-preview editor that allows you to edit the markdown file directly in the preview üéâ.  
  This feature is currently in beta.  
  When the editor is open, you can press `ctrl+s` or `cmd+s` to save the markdown file. You can also press `esc` to close the editor.
- Deprecated the VS Code setting `markdown-preview-enhanced.singlePreview`.  
  Now replaced by `markdown-preview-enhanced.previewMode`:

  - **Single Preview** (_default_)  
    Only one preview will be shown for all editors.
  - **Multiple Previews**  
    Multiple previews will be shown. Each editor has its own preview.
  - **Previews Only** üÜï  
    No editor will be shown. Only previews will be shown. You can use the in-preview editor to edit the markdown.

    üîî Please note that enable this option will automatically modify the `workbench.editorAssociations` setting to make sure the markdown files are opened in the custom editor for preview.

- Added two new VS Code commands `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Customize Preview Html Head (Workspace)` and `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Customize Preview Html Head (Global)`, which will open the `head.html` file for you to customize the `<head>` of the preview.

- Supported to set attribute to image and link, e.g.:

  ```markdown
  ![](path/to/image.png){width=100 height=100}
  ```

- Improved the markdown transformer to better insert anchors for scroll sync and highlight lines and elements.  
  Added more tests for the markdown transformer to make sure it works as expected.
- Added the reading time estimation in the preview footer ‚è≤Ô∏è.
- Added `Edit Markdown` menu item to the context menu of the preview, which offers two options:
  - **Open VS Code Editor**
    Open the markdown file in VS Code editor.
  - **Open In-preview Editor**
    Open the markdown file in the in-preview editor.
- Updated the mermaid version to the latest `10.5.0`
- Updated the `katex` version to `0.16.9`.
- Added the API website: https://shd101wyy.github.io/crossnote/

### Future plan üìã

We will further improve the markdown-it parser ~~and we might remove the pandoc parser support~~. You can still use the pandoc export. This will not be affected. üìù‚úÇÔ∏è

We will add in-preview editing capability in the future. üñãÔ∏è

We will also add the backlinks graph view. üìà

  ````
  ``` {.python}
  def add(x, y):
    return x + y
  ```

  ``` {.mermaid}
  graph LR
  A --> B
  ```
  ````

  The first class in the `{...}` will be regarded as the `language`.

### Bug fixes üêû

- :bug: [Single preview bug](https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/1740)

### MISC üõ†Ô∏è

- Refactored some [crossnote](https://github.com/shd101wyy/crossnote) code.

## [0.7.2] - 2023-09-05

**0.7.2** is a breaking update! And yes, it might break many things and introduce more bugs. But don't worry, we'll fix them! üòÖ

### What's new? üöÄ

- MPE is now available on [VSCode for the Web](https://vscode.dev) ü•á Yes, you can now use MPE in your browser. But some features are limited, like exporting files and code chunks, which are disabled in the browser environment. I am writing this CHANGELOG right now in [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) using the MPE extension üòÉ.

  ![image](https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced/assets/1908863/9222fc77-6bf2-4fd6-bc94-bd8c1953bc24)

- The `mume` library, which powers MPE, is now renamed as [crossnote](https://github.com/shd101wyy/crossnote). This is a complete refactor of the project. We will support more features like backlinks and in-preview editor in the future.
  - Now you can have a `.crossnote` directory for configuring the MPE extension for your workspace. In VSCode, running the command `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Customize CSS (Workspace)` will automatically generate several configuration files for you. There is also a global `.crossnote` directory located at `~/.crossnote` if you are using Windows, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.crossnote` or `~/.local/state/crossnote` if you are using \*nix. The global configuration has lower priority than the workspace one. üõ†Ô∏è
