   If you want the backlinks to be always on in the preview, you can enable the setting:

   ```
   "markdown-preview-enhanced.alwaysShowBacklinksInPreview": true,
   ```

3. Updated [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) to the latest `4.6.0`.

### Bug fixes 🐛

1. 🐞 [Issue 1752](https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/1752)

### Future plan 📋

We will further improve the markdown-it parser ~~and we might remove the pandoc parser support~~. You can still use the pandoc export. This will not be affected. 📝✂️

We will add in-preview editing capability in the future. 🖋️

We will also add the backlinks graph view. 📈

## [0.7.3] - 2023-09-06

### New features 🆕

- ⭐ Added `markdown-preview-enhanced.markdownFileExtensions` config that allows users to specify the file extensions for preview.
- 🌟 Supported pandoc-like code blocks, for example:

  ````
  ``` {.python}
  def add(x, y):
    return x + y
  ```

  ``` {.mermaid}
  graph LR
  A --> B
  ```
  ````

  The first class in the `{...}` will be regarded as the `language`.

### Bug fixes 🐞

- :bug: [Single preview bug](https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/1740)

### MISC 🛠️

- Refactored some [crossnote](https://github.com/shd101wyy/crossnote) code.

## [0.7.2] - 2023-09-05

**0.7.2** is a breaking update! And yes, it might break many things and introduce more bugs. But don't worry, we'll fix them! 😅

### What's new? 🚀

- MPE is now available on [VSCode for the Web](https://vscode.dev) 🥇 Yes, you can now use MPE in your browser. But some features are limited, like exporting files and code chunks, which are disabled in the browser environment. I am writing this CHANGELOG right now in [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev) using the MPE extension 😃.

  ![image](https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced/assets/1908863/9222fc77-6bf2-4fd6-bc94-bd8c1953bc24)

- The `mume` library, which powers MPE, is now renamed as [crossnote](https://github.com/shd101wyy/crossnote). This is a complete refactor of the project. We will support more features like backlinks and in-preview editor in the future.
  - Now you can have a `.crossnote` directory for configuring the MPE extension for your workspace. In VSCode, running the command `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Customize CSS (Workspace)` will automatically generate several configuration files for you. There is also a global `.crossnote` directory located at `~/.crossnote` if you are using Windows, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.crossnote` or `~/.local/state/crossnote` if you are using \*nix. The global configuration has lower priority than the workspace one. 🛠️

    |        | --+ ditaa +--> |       |
    |  Text  |   +-------+    |diagram|

        :                         ^
